Louvain Algorithm with Spanner

Objective: 
Detect communities between nodes in a graph based on the existing connections between them.

Details:
3 Tables are needed: Nodes, edges and nodes_communities. The algorithm is tested with spanner using a multithreading approach and gain comparison for faster graph analysis.
